##  Project Motivation

- People often prioritize affordable accommodation and food when visiting new places. Airbnb, an online marketplace, was created to address this demand by enabling homeowners to rent their spaces for short stays. Compared to hotels, Airbnb offers these services at a more budget-friendly price. Additionally, people worldwide appreciate the cozy and cost-effective experience provided by Airbnb, with services available in various locations worldwide. Thus, this project analyzes Airbnb data to answer the following questions:


1- Room types available with Airbnb and Which room type has a stricter cancellation policy? Why?

2- What are the top 20 Neighbourhoods Offering Short-term Rentals Within 10 Days? Why do you think they are being the top?

3- Describe the construction of rooms by year and predict how the construction of the room is going to be.


## Data Source

The dataset can be downloaded from the below link **Kaggle**:

## File Descriptions

-  It looks like there were fluctuations in the number of rooms constructed each year.

  * There were some years with a high number of rooms constructed and others with a lower number.

  *  Overall, the trend is not very clear - it seems to go up and down without a consistent pattern.
